# [STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series using Deep Learning

*Work-in-Progress (Will begin at Oct 22. 2018)*

This is a repository for the [[STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series using Deep Learning](https://studypie.co/course/machine-learning/price_predict/)

## Introduction
- Instructor: [Jongho Kim](https://jonghkim.github.io/), Quantitative Researcher at NICE Pricing and Information (quantic.jh@gmail.com)
- This session guide you to implement three different projects for predicting financial time series
- This session DOES NOT aim to learn automatic trading systems, rather DOES focus on stock / coin price prediction based on deep learning, pursuing the most essential algorithms
- This session is an intermediate level course for those who have basic knowledge (Python, Numpy, Pandas, pip) of Python and machine learning

## Goal of this study
- Understand the problems with financial time series predictions and advantages/disadvantages of machine learning 
- Learn how to implement FNN, CNN, RNN models using Tensorflow Keras API on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
- Learn which metrics could be important for robustness of time series prediction algorithms 
- Learn how to implement your own neural network models with cryptocurrency data which includes bid/ask volumes, minute level prices and trading volumes 

## Modules
- This session is desinged with four modules:
    - [Module 1. Deep Learning Revisiting](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module1)
    - [Module 2. RNN Model for Price Prediction](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module2)
    - [Module 3. CNN Encoder  + RNN Model for Price Prediction](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module3)
    - [Module 4. Wavelet Denoising + Auto Encoder Model + RNN Prediction Model](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module4)

## Datasets
- This session use three datasets:
    - Dogs vs Cats dataset from Microsoft [[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Dje13qjGZwtaVhhjp-ZJVzeyzJrG6oc1)] (For simplicity, we only use 300 images for each animal)
    - Public dataset: Prices of multiple crypotocurrecies from pythonprogramming.net [[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1thjGhgnAm5k1zuSiWhGmlUJzBXM3IECi)]
    - Self Crawled dataset: Prices and orderbook data of multiple crypotocurrecies from CoinOne [[Downloadable on Request](mailto:quantic.jh@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20CoinOne%20Data%20Requests)]
